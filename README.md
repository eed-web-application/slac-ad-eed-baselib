# Base lib for AD-EED java microservices

This is a proposed template for SLAC software development.  
We hope that this template can be used to encourage best practices in both code organization and SLAC/Stanford collaboration compliance.  
The default state is set to 'private' but we are encouraging open sharing of DOE funded developments with funding attribution and potentially hosting at [OSTI DOE-CODE](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/).  

# SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
